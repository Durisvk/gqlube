Current issues:

Near Future:

- [ ] Make better mutations API to update queries
- [ ] Try out codegen project on react example
- [ ] Test out gradually incrementing query
- [ ] Provide apollo client example
- [ ] Support unions
- [ ] Support fragments
- [ ] Support for subscriptions
- [ ] Support calculated fields

Ideas:

- [ ] Support useQuery identifiers so that updates from mutations can be done easier
- [ ] Allow passing custom options into Fetcher (e.g. specific to apollo client)
- [ ] Use gql tag once the query string is generated
